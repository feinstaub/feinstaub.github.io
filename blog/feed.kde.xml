                <title>Dolphin Tip - Investigate Disk Usage</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;Hi,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://quickgit.kde.org/?p=kde-baseapps.git&amp;amp;a=commit&amp;amp;h=f742843eb3e7935cb10803a09a19d72438528620&quot;&gt;since quite some time&lt;/a&gt;, there is a new feature in dolphin which helps to investigate the disk usage of the current directory (or mount point etc.). The feature is a bit hidden, so I decided to write this post:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Left-click on the disk space bar (located on the right side of dolphin’s status bar). The following menu opens, see screenshot:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/blog/assets/2016-01-29-view-disk-usage-via-dolphin.1-menu.png&quot; alt=&quot;view-disk-usage-via-dolphin&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first two menu items open Filelight with different entry points (current folder or current mount point), the third one is KDiskFree. In a submenu, there are also other tools available.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One nice thing is that you can configure (via submenu More -&amp;gt; Configure…) which programs should be shown in the main menu and in which order. The others will be kept in the submenu. Even if a program is not installed you will find it in the submenu for you to discover.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Note, that in case Filelight is already installed, you can still (and could in the past) also reach it from the folders context menu -&amp;gt; “Open with” -&amp;gt; Filelight.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s it. If you happen to come across another program that could be useful in the disk usage context and you think it could also be useful for others, feel free to &lt;a href=&quot;https://bugs.kde.org/enter_bug.cgi?product=frameworks-knewstuff&quot;&gt;file a bug report&lt;/a&gt; (severity “wishlist”, topic “KMoreTools: new disk usage tool for dolphin: …”). If accepted, this program would then appear in the submenu for other users to be discovered and you could configure it to appear in the main menu.&lt;/p&gt;

                <title>kreenshot-editor is incubating</title>
                <description>&lt;p&gt;With this post I would like to introduce a new project: kreenshot-editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of you who often do screenshots under MS Windows will probably know
&lt;a href=&quot;http://getgreenshot.org/&quot;&gt;Greenshot&lt;/a&gt; which is - as they say on their website -
“a free screenshot tool optimized for productivity”. It is GPL licensed and
written in C#.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;built-in image editor of Greenshot&lt;/strong&gt; is specifically designed to edit
screenshot images. You can draw basic shapes like rectangles, ellipses,
and arrows, add text and also add rectangular areas which apply a pixelizing or blurring effect.
Each of these objects is movable, resizable and deletable and there is undo/redo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noteably, the mouse cursor is (optionally) captured as
separate object which then can be moved or deleted after taking the screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;strong&gt;kreenshot-editor&lt;/strong&gt; is a new Qt-based project that was inspired by Greenshot’s image editor.
It is hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.kde.org/projects/playground/graphics/kreenshot-editor&quot;&gt;KDE playground&lt;/a&gt;.
It focuses on the image editing
task, can be invoked from command line and should also provide a resuable
editor component which could be integrated into other screencapture tools.
The current code is already separated into an image editor widget and the
main application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kreenshot-editor is still experimental, only basic features are implemented
and there are currently some non-functional UI elements. Yet, it is already usable - if
you don’t care that the color of objects is fixed to red ;-). Currently, you can
create new objects, move them around, delete them, do undo/redo, load/save image,
configure output filename pattern etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feinstaub.github.io/kreenshot-editor/&quot;&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;
  (includes some screenshots and hints how to contribute)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;amp;t=125841&quot;&gt;Discussions go here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
