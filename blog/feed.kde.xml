                <title>Incubating kreenshot-editor</title>

                <description>&lt;p&gt;With this post I would like to introduce a new project: kreenshot-editor.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Those of you who often do screenshots under MS Windows will probably know
&lt;a href=&quot;http://getgreenshot.org/&quot;&gt;Greenshot&lt;/a&gt; which is - as they say on their website -
“a free screenshot tool optimized for productivity”. It is GPL licensed and
written in C#.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;built-in image editor of Greenshot&lt;/strong&gt; is specifically designed to edit
screenshot images. You can draw basic shapes like rectangles, ellipses,
and arrows, add text and also apply a pixelizing or blurring rectangluar areas.
Each of these objects is movable, resizable and deletable and there is undo/redo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Noteably, the mouse cursor is (optionally) captured as
separate object which then can be moved or deleted after taking the screenshot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, &lt;strong&gt;kreenshot-editor&lt;/strong&gt; is a new Qt-based project that was inspired by Greenshot’s image editor.
It is hosted on &lt;a href=&quot;https://projects.kde.org/projects/playground/graphics/kreenshot-editor&quot;&gt;KDE playground&lt;/a&gt;.
It focuses on the image editing
task, can be invoked from command line and should also provide a resuable
editor component which could be integrated into other screencapture tools.
The current code is already separated into an image editor widget and the
main application.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kreenshot-editor is still experimental, only basic features are implemented
and there are currently some non-functional UI elements. Yet, it is already usable - if
you don’t care that the color of objects is fixed to red ;-). Currently, you can
create new objects, move them around, delete them, do undo/redo, load/save image,
configure output filename pattern etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://feinstaub.github.io/kreenshot-editor/&quot;&gt;Website&lt;/a&gt;
  (includes some screenshots and hints how to contribute)&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://forum.kde.org/viewtopic.php?f=19&amp;amp;t=125841&quot;&gt;Discussions go here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
