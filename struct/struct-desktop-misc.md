Plasma [usability]: ! Plus/minus file selection "buttons" should have hover effect
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2014-09-20, WAIT for KF5, not reported yet, no existing bug searched yet

Current situation: confusing for people: click on the text of a file or on the icon which happens to have the plus/minus symbol have different actions:
1. Selection, 2. add to selection

Good example but only works when preview images are enabled:

Mouse not hover: ![](img/selection_plus_minus-good-example-mouse-not-over.png)


Mouse hover: ![](img/selection_plus_minus-good-example-mouse-over.png)

SUGGESTION:
Add a hover effect to the plus/minus button so that the user can see that there is a different operation.
