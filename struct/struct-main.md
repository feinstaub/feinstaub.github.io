Dolphin - Wish: Drag and Drop to compress
-----------------------------------------
2014:

TODO: make it public to community (first: check latest plasma)

When dropping selected files and or folders to some folder the user gets a menu with the following options:

### CURRENT

  * Move here
  * Copy here
  * Link here

When dropping an archive file (zip, rar, tgz etc.) there is already an “Extract here” menu item.

### SUGGESTED
Add a new item with submenu items taken from the standard Compress context menu.

  * Compress here >
    * Here
    * As ZIP Archive
    * As RAR Archive
    * …
    * Compress To…

### Use cases where current methods are inconvenient
  * Goal is to compress a local folder on an external drive (e.g. to archive the folder away).
  With suggested method it is easy to minimize the data will be transferred from one drive to the other.
